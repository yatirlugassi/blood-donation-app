## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers or logs in using Supabase Auth
2. Session is stored and managed by AuthContext
3. Protected routes check for authenticated state
4. Session refresh happens automatically

### Donation Management
1. Users can add new donations with details
2. Donations are stored in the database
3. Users can view their donation history
4. Statistics are calculated based on donation history

### Blood Compatibility
1. Users can check compatibility between blood types
2. Regional needs are displayed with visual indicators
3. Compatibility checks are logged for analytics

### Community Features
1. Users can create posts to share experiences
2. Posts can be liked and commented on
3. Leaderboard shows top donors
4. Users can view their ranking

### Notification System
1. Users receive notifications for various events
2. Notifications can be marked as read or deleted
3. Users can customize notification preferences

### Goal Setting
1. Users can set donation goals with target dates
2. Progress is tracked automatically
3. Completed goals are marked and celebrated

## Testing
- Unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library
- Tests cover authentication, forms, and key functionality
- Mock Supabase client for testing database interactions

## Pending Tasks
1. Implement remaining tests for all components
2. Add more detailed analytics for donation patterns
3. Enhance mobile responsiveness
4. Add internationalization support
5. Implement social sharing features

## Design Decisions
1. **Hebrew Language**: The application is primarily in Hebrew to serve the target audience
2. **Blood Type Compatibility**: Using a matrix-based approach for accurate compatibility checking
3. **Community Focus**: Emphasizing community aspects to encourage donation
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Building core functionality first, then enhancing with additional features

## Next Steps
1. Complete test suite implementation
2. Deploy to production environment
3. Gather user feedback
4. Implement analytics tracking
5. Add additional features based on user feedback
